# ValueInvestor

The project aims to study different portfolio investment companies through classical and machine learning models. These models are utilized for stock price prediction, which helps with investment strategies in emerging markets worldwide. Profits are generated by investing, buying, holding, and selling company stocks based on model predictions and value investing principles. This repository contains separate notebook for each investment company, the list of companies studied here are as follows:

- Russia - Sberbank Rossii PAO (SBER)
- Turkey - Koc Holding AS (KCHOL)
- Egypt - Medinet Nasr Housing (MNH)
- Brazil - Minerva SABrazil (BEEF3)
- Argentina - Pampa Energia SA (PAMP)
- South Africa - Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd (IMPJ) 

Given the trading data of different companies from 2020 Q1 to 2021 Q1 stock prices. Each notebook aims to train different ML models on data from 2020 and predict stock prices for the 2021 Q1 data. Finally, recommendations are provided (BUY, HOLD, and SELL decisions) to maximize capital returns and minimize losses. The project explores three popular approaches to learning from time-series data:

- The classic ARIMA framework for time series prediction
- Facebookâ€™s in-house model Prophet, which is specifically designed for learning from business time series
- The LSTM model, a powerful recurrent neural network approach that has been used to achieve the best-known results for many problems on sequential data
